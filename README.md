# openEHR-archetypes

Here you will find mostly archetype updates and requests/suggestions to openEHR CKM. Some are used in internal projects only, but as personal choice I will have them here too in case someone wants to take some ideas or even use them. Please always use the international CKM as you main source of search and usage. What is in this repository can be on that CKM, but already extremely outdated.
